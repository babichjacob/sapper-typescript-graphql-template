## ‚ùì What is this?

This is an extension to the [official Sapper Rollup template](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template-rollup) with TypeScript preprocessing and a GraphQL server through TypeGraphQL (Apollo Server).

If you're looking for something with much, much more bundled in, check out [my opinionated project base](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-firebase-typescript-graphql-tailwindcss-actions-template).

## üß≠ Project Status
**This project base will continue to be maintained** [until SvelteKit is ready](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit). 

Once you are prepared to migrate, check out the [Svelte Adders](https://github.com/babichjacob/svelte-adders) project for information about how to recreate this project base's functionality. You should specifically look at [svelte-add-graphql](https://github.com/babichjacob/svelte-add-graphql).

**Read on to use this project base today:**

## üìã Copy

Choose either to clone or fork depending on your preference.

### üêë Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template
```

### üç¥ Fork

Click the `Use this template` button on [this project's GitHub page](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template).

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Install Dependencies

```sh
cd sapper-typescript-graphql-template
npm install  # pnpm also works
```

## üõ† Usage

### üß™ Development
```sh
npm run dev
```

### üî® Building for Production
```sh
npm run prod
```

### üì¶ Exporting a Static Site
Your GraphQL server will not be exported with the rest of the site.

```sh
npm run export
```

## ‚öô Configuration

### ‚ö° Web app
Many of the fields in `static/manifest.json` (`short_name`, `name`, `description`, `categories`, `theme_color`, and `background_color`) are filled with demonstrative values that won't match your site. Similarly, you've got to take new screenshots to replace the included `static/screenshot-1.png` and `static/screenshot-2.png` files. If you want, you can add [app shortcut definitions for "add to home screen" on Android](https://web.dev/app-shortcuts/#define-app-shortcuts-in-the-web-app-manifest). Once you change `theme_color`, update the `meta name="theme-color"` tag in `src/template.html` to match.

The [Apple touch icon](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html), favicon, and `logo-` files (also all in the `static` directory) are created by placing the logo within a "safe area" centered circle that takes up 80% of the canvas's dimension. For instance, the constraining circle in `logo-512.png` is 512 √ó 0.80 = 409.6 ‚âà 410 pixels wide and tall. 

### üó∫ Source maps
This project base comes with [source maps](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-source-maps) enabled during development and disabled during production for the best compromise between performance and developer experience. You can change this behavior through the `sourcemap` variable in `rollup.config.js`.

### üï∏ Optionally removing the GraphQL server
1. Remove these lines in `src/server.ts`:
    1. ```ts
       import { createApolloServer } from "./graphql";
       ```
    2. ```ts
       const apolloServer = await createApolloServer();
       ```
    3. ```ts
       apolloServer.applyMiddleware({ app, path: graphqlPath });
       ```

2. Remove the now-useless `graphqlPath` parameter to `createSapperAndApolloServer` in `src/server.ts`. This is also a good opportunity to rename the function since there is no longer an Apollo Server

3. Delete the `src/graphql` folder

4. Uninstall the `apollo-server-express`, `bufferutil`, `class-validator`, `graphql`, `reflect-metadata`, `type-graphql`, and `utf-8-validate` packages

## üòµ Help! I have a question

[Create an issue](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template/issues/new) and I'll try to help.

## üò° Fix! There is something that needs improvement

[Create an issue](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template/issues/new) or [pull request](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template/pulls) and I'll try to fix.

I'm sorry, because of my skill level and the fragility of (the combination of) some of these tools, there are likely to be problems in this project. Thank you for bringing them to my attention or fixing them for me.
